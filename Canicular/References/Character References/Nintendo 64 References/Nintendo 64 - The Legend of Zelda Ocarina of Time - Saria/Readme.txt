Here is saria from legend of zelda, the textures are a bit large but they still work.
i tried to add in bones but when i export it from blender to an object file they stop working.
it is quite easy to make your own bones for this model if you need to.
if you use this could you give credit to Alec Pike, or at least try to remember my name?
if you have any comments or complaints or need help with the model 
or something e-mail me at alec.pike@gmail.com

This model was fixed to an unanimated pose by Zerox. No credit necessary for that though.
